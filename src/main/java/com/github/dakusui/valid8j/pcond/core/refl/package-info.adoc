Offers a mechanism to invoke a method dynamically.

The `pcond` has a capability to construct a function predicate that invokes method of a given name on a target object.

public class Example {
  public void example() {
      requireArgument("hello", Predicates.callp("startsWith", "H"));
  }
}

This use case requires to resolve a method to be called actually at runtime.
This is a less straight-forward task than initially looks because we need to take into account the situations, where the methods are overloaded, etc.

This package is intended to provide the mechanism to achieve it.
