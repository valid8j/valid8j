= `valid8j`: Unified DbC, Value Checking, Test Assertion Library

`valid8j` (pronounced "validate-j") is a DbC (design by contract<<DbC>>) library named after `valid4j`<<valid4j>>.

It can be also used as a value chcking library such as Guava's `Preconditions` class or a test assertion library like AssertJ or Google Truth.

One thing to be noted here is that it offers uniformed and consistent way of doing these unlike any other existing libraries.
At the same time, it offers readability both in codes and in messages on failures.
Not only that, it provides a fluent programming interface where your IDE help you come up with what you want to write next.

The benefit of `pcond` over `hamcrest` is its compatibility and extensibility.
Instead of "matchers" that `hamcrest` uses to verify values, `pcond` uses Java's plain `Predicate` and provide useful preset predicates from which you can build your own predicates for complex types.
So, you can reuse the predicates you created for assertions for other purposes, such as value checking and testing.

A design idea behind `pcond` is following:
When a human checks test results, he/she wants to "see" the values on a display screen as texts.
But what sort of values they can check?
Numbers, texts, boolean, null, or compound values of them.
Database records, HTTP requests, responses, List, Map, ... they can be decomposed into the handful of value types.
If cannot, they cannot be understood by human, either way.
If so, when a human checks such a complex value, what human does will be to extract a certain aspect of the original complex value as a simple value and check if it satisfies a certain predicate for a simple value type.
If so, the mechanism we desire for a versatile assertion library is not to be able to build a matcher for any types, but to be able to define a function to "transform"  a given object to a simple value, and provide a useful and preset predicates sufficient for checking the extracted value.

This allows you to use the library for your custom class very easily.

Not only that, it allows "no-overhead" execution of assertions, which gives no performance penalty at production code, yet keeping its descriptiveness on failures.


== Getting Started

Have a following maven dependency in your `pom.xml`.

[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.github.dakusui</groupId>
  <artifactId>valid8j</artifactId>
  <version>{valid8j-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Visit https://oss.sonatype.org/[oss.sonatype.org] to figure out the most recent version of `valid8j`.

== Programming with `pcond` twins

`valid8j` and `valid8j` are twins of `pcond` and both libraries for value checking, but intended to be used in respectively different contexts.
`valid8j` is desinged to be used in test assertions, while `valid8j` should be used for Design by Contract style programming and general value checking in production code.
In these contexts, how to build a condition to check a value and compose an appropriate message for its failure are common concern.
However, there is no uniformed style that can be applied to all those.
`pcond` and its twins are designed to address this challenge.

=== First Example

Following is the first example of the `valid8j` library.

[%nowrap,java]
.ThincrestExample.java
----
public class ThincrestExample {
  @Test
  public void testString() {
    assertThat(
        "hello World",
        transform(function("toUpperCase", o -> Objects.toString(o).toUpperCase())) // <1> <2>
            .check(containsString("HELLO"))); // <3>
  }
}
----
<1> `Predicates.transform(Function<,>)`
<2> `Printables.function(String, Function<,>)`
<3> `Predicates.containsString(String)`

For readability's sake, it's recommended to extract a function, where possible.

[%nowrap,java]
.ThincrestExample.java
----
public class ThincrestExample {
  @Test
  public void testString() {
    assertThat(
        "hello World",
        transform(toUpperCase()).check(containsString("HELLO")));
  }

  private static Function<String, String> toUpperCase() {
    return function("toUpperCase", o -> Objects.toString(o).toUpperCase());
  }
}
----

The programming style of `valid8j` is to first transform a given value into better known type or form, which is more suitable for examining its validity.

In this example, a given string is first transformed into all upper cases so that it is equal to "HELLO" if we ignore cases.

This results in a following output.

.Output of Example.java
|===
|Expectation |Actual

a|
[%nowrap]
----
    "Howdy, World"->transform:toUpperCase       ->"HOWDY, WORLD"
[0] "HOWDY, WORLD"->check:containsString[HELLO] ->true

.Detail of failure [0]
---
containsString[hello]
---
----

[%nowrap]
----
    "Howdy, World"->transform:toUpperCase       ->"HOWDY, WORLD"
[0] "HOWDY, WORLD"->check:containsString[HELLO] ->false

.Detail of failure [0]
---
HOWDY, WORLD
---
----
|===

You can see the violated condition and how it is violated in the stacktrace.

A philosophy behind `valid8j` 's approach is:

- A human in the end checks the value on a screen as a text.
- Either way, test can only report a presence of a bug, cannot ensure absence of it.
If so, rather than trying to build "matcher", "subject", or "assertion" objects that can do a check that detects all the bugs for a given class, it will be more productive to decompose the check into various checks, each of which is concise and understandable.

The style of `valid8j`, where you pass a value and a predicate that checks it to a library entry-point method, is the same for `valid8j`.

=== "Printable" Predicate

To verify a value with `valid8j`, you can call a value checking method of them with your value and a predicate to be checked.

[source]
----
valueCheckingMethod(aValue, predicate);
----

Value checking methods are defined as public static methods in classes such as `TestAssertions` or `Requires`.
It is recommended to import them statically at the beginning of your class.

You can give your own lambda as a predicate to the method, however it will result in non-user friendly string such as following.

[source]
----
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: value:"JohnDoe" violated precondition:value java.util.function.Predicate$$Lambda$78/2047329716@46f7f36a
----

This is still better than nothing, however, probably it will be much better if you can see what a condition the value "JohnDoe" violated and how it did without visiting the source code.
In order to make `valid8j` and `valid8j` print a better message on a failure, you need to give a "printable" predicate.

`pcond`, which powers `valid8j` and `valid8j`, offers a set of method to create a printable predicate in `Predicates` class.
It also offers a way to construct a conjunction, disjunction, and negation of given printable predicates.

To create a non-printable function and predicate, you can use static methods in `Printables` class.

- `Printables.function(Supplier<String> formatter, Function<T, R> function)`
- `Printables.function(String name, Function<T, R> function)`
- `Printables.predicate(Supplier<String> formatter, Predicate<T> predicate)`
- `Printables.predicate(String name, Predicate<T> predicate)`

In the first example above, we already used one of them.:

[source, java]
----
public class PrintableFunctionsExample {
    public static void example() {
        Printables.function("toUpperCase", String::upperCase);
        Printables.predicate("longerThan10", s -> s.length() > 10);
    }
}
----

However, if we create a large number of printable functions and predicates one by one, the message you set for them will be not manageable and error-prone.
Instead, we should think of a way to keep them manageable by reusing them.
A way `pcond` offers is to construct a more complex predicate and functions from simpler ones.

Following is an example.

----
and(isNotNull(), transform(length()).check(gt(0)), containsString(" "))

// Don't try: v -> isNotNull().test(v) && transform(...).test(v) && containsString(" ").test(v)
// It will result in the cryptography-like lambda's toString() text.
----

`isNotNull` is a method that returns a predicate which returns `true` if a value given to `test` method is not `null`.
And its `toString` method is overridden so that it returns a string `isNotNull`.

`and` is another method that returns a printable predicate.
The method accepts predicates and constructs a new printable predicate that is a conjunction of them.

NOTE: There is another method `allOf`.
The difference is `and` aborts its evaluation at the first fail, while `allOf` keeps going until the end.
For test assertions, where you need an entire picture of the execution, `allOf` will be more convenient.
The relationship between `or` and `anyOf` is the same.

NOTE: `Predicate#and`, `Predicate#or`, and `Predicate#negate` methods are overridden in printable functions appropriately, so you can use them either.
But it may sometimes be cumbersome to give generic parameter types explicitly.

`transform` and `check` structure needs a bit more explanation than others.

----
transform(length()).check(gt(0))
----

This line constructs a printable predicate which returns `true` if a length of a given string is greater than (`gt`) 0.

NOTE: This is a little artificial example to illustrate the usage of the `transform` and `check` structure.
You can achieve the same thing with `Predicates.isEmptyString()` and it will be simpler and faster.

First the method `transfom` accepts, preferably a printable, function.
In this case a function returned by `length` method, which is defined in `Functions` class, is passed to the method.
Now it returns a factory for a printable predicate.
The `check` method of the factory returns a new predicate that checks a transformed value by the first function.
With this `transform` and `check` approach, you can build various printable predicates from preset ones.

=== Examining a Value: Value Checking Methods

`pcond` offers a couple of styles to build conditions, one is conventional, which we already used in the examples in the earlier sections.
The other is "fluent" style, which will be covered in this section.

For each of them, `valid8j` and `valid8j` have different set of classes and methods.

==== Conventional Value Checking Methods of `valid8j`

In this category, there are only a couple of static methods.
For both of them, the first parameter is a value to be checked and the second is a (printable) predicate used for the check.

`assertThat` (`TestAssertions`):: Use this for normal test assertions.
`assumeThat` (`TestAssertions`):: Use this for checking an assumption to execute a test is satisfied or not.

To add an explanation to `assumeThat`, suppose that you have a test only valid on Microsoft Windows platform.
What should happen if it is run on a Linux-based platform?
If it fails, it means your product doesn't compile on Linux.
So, you want it to be ignored.
In this situation, you can write `assumeThat(isRunningOnWindowsPlatorm())` and `AssumptionViolatedException`, which make JUnit4 mark the test ignored,  will be thrown.

==== Fluent Value Checking Methods of `valid8j`

Methods end with `Statement` accepts only one `Statement`, while ones end with `All` accepts multiple statements.
Basically, they are doing the same thing and just defined as "syntax-sugara" for readability's sake.

`assertStatement` (`TestFluents`):: Use this for normal test assertions.
`assertAll` (`TestCluents`):: Use this for normal test assertions, where you need to check multiple values at once.
`assumeStatement` (`TestFluents`):: Use this for checking an assumption to execute a test is satisfied or not.
`assumeAll` (`TestFluents`):: Use this for checking an assumption to execute a test is satisfied or not in a situation, where you need to check multiple conditions at once.

For the detail of how to create a statement object, check <<WritingYourCodeFluently>>.

==== Conventional Value Checking Methods of `valid8j`

Depending on the context, where you are going to examine a given value, an appropriate message and exception to be thrown on a failure can be different.
`pcond` provides methods that offer such messages and exceptions.
You can simply call methods with the value and the condition you are going to examine.
Followings are methods for it and classes in which they are defined.

`requireXyz` (`Preconditions`):: Methods for checking "preconditions", which a user of your product needs to satisfy.
On a failure, a `RuntimeException` such as `NullPointerException` etc. will be thrown depending on the actual method.
`Xyz` can be `NonNull`, `Argument`, or `State`.
`ensureXyz` (`Postconditions`):: Methods for checking "postconditions" , which your product needs to satisfy for its user.
These methods also throw `RuntimeException` s depending on an actual prefix `Xyz` .
`Xyz` can be `NonNull` or `State`.
`validate` (`Validations`):: This is also used for checking "preconditions".
However, unlike `requireXyz` methods, it throws an `ApplicationException`, which is a checked exception (not a `RuntimeException`).
This method should be used in a situation where a "recoverable" failure happens.
`assert xyz` (`Assertions`):: This should be used for checking "internal" error, where you want to disable the check in production code.
`xyz` can be `precondition`, `postcondition`, `invariant` and `that`.
The usege of the first three is self-explanatory.
`that` is used for the other purposes.
In case you want to use `assert` for any other purposes than them, use `that`.

To check your user's error, use `requireXyz` or `validate`.
When there is a simple and easy way to check the condition before calling your function, use `requireXyz`.
Otherwise, use `validate` to allow your user to handle the error.
To check your own fault, use `ensureXyz` or `assert xyz`.
If the check should be done even in the production, i.e. it can be broken by your user, use `ensureXyz`.
Otherwise, use `assert xyz`.
Because the check can only be broken by your own fault (bug), which should not exist in your production code.

Among all of those, `assert xyz` has a quite outstanding characteristic, where it can be completely disabled by `-da` option to your JVM and does not have any performance overhead at all if it is disabled.

.Design by Contract Example
----
public class ExampleDbC {
    public void publicWithdraw(int amount) {
        requireArgument(amount, greaterThan(0));                         // <1>
        privateWithdraw(amount);
        this.balance = updateDatabase(this.balance + amount);
        ensureState(this.balance, greaterThanOrEqualTo(amount));         // <2>
    }

    private void privateWithdraw(int amount) {
        assert precondition(amount, isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(0));          // <3>
        balance += amount;
        assert postcondition(this.balance, isGreaterThanOrEqualTo(0));   // <4>
    }
}
----
<1> Check incoming argument value.
Since externally exposed method should protect itself by rejecting invalid value, use `requireArgument(s)`.
<2> If the result of `updateDatabase` is not consistent with any of known constraints, we should consider that something went wrong inside the method, and it should be reported to caller side.
In general, inconsistency that can happen at runtime in production because of
<3> It is a design of this class that `publicWithdraw` makes sure only valid value comes into inside.
If so, the value for `amount` will not be 0 or less.
This is a "belief" that can be checked by `assert` statement.
<4> If `this.balance` becomes less than 0, we should think we are detecting an internal error.
In production, this check is useless and just a performance over-head, because such bugs should be fixed before releasing.
Such a check should be done with `assert` so that it can be turned off  in production.


==== Fluent Value Checking Methods of `valid8j`

The matrix below shows "Fluent" versions of value checking methods of `valid8j`.
They are defined in `ValidationFluents` class.

There are two axes to think of `valid8j` 's use cases.
One is targets, for which a check is made.
The other is context, what the check means.

There are four possible targets, which are arguments, states, general conditions, and general conditions in `assert`.
About contexts, there are three possible items, which are precondition, invariant, and postcondition.

For each of these combinations, a couple of methods are defined, singular and plural, for the code readability's sake.

Following is a matrix that describes the methods for fluent style in `valid8j`.

[cols="1,3,3,3, 3"]
|===
|              |Argument|State|General Condition|General Condition (`assert`)

|precondition
a|
- `requireArgument`
- `requireArguments`
a|
- `requireState`
- `requireStates`
a|
- `requireStatement`
- `requireAll`
a|
- `precondition`
- `preconditions`

|invariant
|N/A
|N/A
|N/A
a|
- `that`
- `all`

|postcondition

|N/A
a|
- `ensureState`
- `ensureStates`
a|
- `ensureStatement`
- `ensureAll`
a|
- `postcondition`
- `postconditions`
|===

The first three targets are intended to be used mainly in public methods to defend your program from invalid input values given externally.
The last one (`assert`) is intended to be used mainly in private methods to detect bugs you created inside your product.

=== Reading the Output

Look at the first line of the output you see in a failure.
There's a message:

----
value:"JohnDoe" violated precondition:value ((isNotNull&&!isEmpty)&&containsString[" "])
----

This is describing the value that was examined and the condition violated by it.

The next several lines explain how a given value violated a condition to be satisfied.

----
&&                               -> false
  isNotNull("JohnDoe")           -> true
  transformAndCheck              -> true
    length("JohnDoe")            -> 7
    >[0](7)                      -> true
  containsString[" "]("JohnDoe") -> false
----

See the last line, this means the given string `JohnDoe` made a condition `containsString[" "]` `false`, and it made the entire check fail.
`pcond` is designed to shortcut an evaluation as soon as a value of a disjunctive or conjunctive predicate becomes fixed.
That is, if you have an `or` condition, and the first predicate under it becomes `true`, the rest will not be evaluated at all.
So the last line in the message always shows the direct reason why the check failed.

Thus, you can read the output above as "The check failed because the value `\"JohnDoe\"` `containsString[" "]` was `false`.
"

[[WritingYourCodeFluently]]
=== Writing your Code Fluently

Following is an example that illustrates how to use "Fluent" API of `valid8j` to build a test.

[source,java]
----
public class FluentExample {
  public void assertSalute() {
    Salute salute = new Salute();
    assertStatement(                  // <1>
        objectValue(salute)           // <2>
            .invoke("inJapanese")     // <3>
            .asString()               // <4>
            .length()                 // <5>
            .then()                   // <6>
            .greaterThan(2));         // <7>
  }
}
----

<1> `TestFluents.assertStatement(...)`.
This method takes one `Statement` as a parameter.
<2> `Statement.objectValue(...)` ObjectTransformer
<3> `invoke(String methodName, Object... args)` is a method to invoke a method on an object given to `objectValue`.
Usually you can specify a method that you want to test.
This method returns `ObjectTransformer` since you cannot make any assumption on the type at compile-time.
<4> You need to let the compiler know you want to use `StringTransformer` for the returned value, instead of `ObjectTransformer`.
<5> This method calls `String#length()` method on the current object and returns `IntegerTransformer`.
<6> Let the current transformer know that now you want to check the transformed value.
This method returns a corresponding checker, in this case, it will be `IntegerChecker`.
<7> Add a check if the current value is greater than 2 to the current checker.
Since `Checker` is extending `Statement`, this compiles without calling a builder method to make it a `Statement` instance.

You can build a more complex assertion for your test using `transform(...)` method.

[source,java]
----
public class FluentExample {
  public void assertAllSalutes() {
    Salute salute = new Salute();
    assertAll(                                  // <1>
        objectValue(salute)
            .invoke("inJapanese")               // <2>
            .asString()
            .length()
            .then()
            .greaterThan(2),
        objectValue(salute)
            .invoke("inEnglish")
            .asString()
            .transform(                         // <3>
                v -> allOf(v.length().then()    // <4>
                            .greaterThan(10)
                            .toPredicate(),     // <5>
                           v.then()
                            .contains("Hello")
                            .toPredicate())));
  }
}
----

<1> To assert multiple statements at once, use `TestAssertions.assertAll(Statement... statements)`.
<2> `ObjectTransformer#invoke(String,Object...):Object` is a method that invokes a method of a given object.
<3> `transform(Function<XyzTransfomer<Xya>, Predicate<Xyz> clause)`
<4> `Predicates.allOf(Predicate<> ...)` can be used here to branch the checking procedure.
In this case, we want to check if a salute in English is longer than ten characters, and it contains a word `"Hello"`.
<5> A checker has a method `toPredicate()`, which builds a printable predicate from the conditions that have been added to it.

In case of a failure, the test above will print a message like following:
